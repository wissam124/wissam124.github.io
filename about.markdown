Research blog.

The blog's title was taken from Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace.

>But you never know when the magic will descend on you. You never know when the
grooves will open up. And once the magic descends you don’t want to change even
the smallest detail. You don’t know what concordance of factors and variables
yields that calibrated can’t-miss feeling, and you don’t want to soil the magic
by trying to figure it out, but you don’t want to change your grip, your stick,
your side of the court, your angle of incidence to the sun.
